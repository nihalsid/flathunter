# Currently supported services: www.immobilienscout24.de,

# Define filters to exclude flats that don't meet your critera.
# Supported filters include 'max_rooms', 'min_rooms', 'max_size', 'min_size',
#   'max_price', 'min_price', and 'excluded_titles'.
#
# 'excluded_titles' takes a list of regex patterns that match against
# the title of the flat. Any matching titles will be excluded.
# More to Python regex here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

# Example:
# filters:
#   excluded_titles:
#     - "wg"
#     - "zwischenmiete"
#   min_price: 700
#   max_price: 1000

blacklist:
  - Innenstadt

# If an expose includes an address, the bot is capable of
# displaying the distance and time to travel (duration) to
# some configured other addresses, for specific kinds of
# travel.
#  
# Available kinds of travel ('gm_id') can be found in the
# Google Maps API documentation, but basically there are:
# 	- "bicycling"
#	- "transit" (public transport)
#	- "driving"
#   - "walking"
# 
# The example configuration below includes a place for
# "John", located at the main train station of munich.
# Two kinds of travel (bicycle and transit) are requested,
# each with a different label. Furthermore a place for
# "Jane" is included, located at the given destination and
# with the same kinds of travel.

    - name: John
      destination: Hauptbahnhof, München
      modes:

          - gm_id: bicycling
            title: "Rad"
    - name: Jane
      destination: Karlsplatz, München
      modes: 
          - gm_id: transit
            title: "Öff."
          - gm_id: driving

# Sending messages using Telegram requires a Telegram Bot configured. 
# Telegram.org offers a good documentation about how to create a bot.
# Once you read it, will make sense. Still: bot_token should hold the
# access token of your bot and receiver_ids should list the client ids
# of receivers. Note that those receivers are required to already have
# started a conversation with your bot.
